# CO2 Emissions Analysis
The goal of this project is to thoroughly investigate and understand the current state of carbon emissions across the globe. By utilizing various data analysis techniques such as exploratory data analysis, correlation analysis, and time-series forecasting, the project aims to reveal patterns, trends, and connections between carbon emissions, GDP and population.Specifically , the project will carry out the following:

Explaoratory analyis on emission trends at global, regional and country level
Correlation Analysis to determine the relationship between carbon emissions and other factors such as GDP and Population
Time series analysis to forecast the global emission levels for the next five years
The datasets used for these analyis have been obtained from 'Our World in Data (OWID)' at https://ourworldindata.org/ and will cover the period from the year 1750 to the year 2021 with a focus on data from the 1900s to 2021.
